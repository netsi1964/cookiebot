# cookiebot
Simple test of cookiebot

This is a simple test of [Cookiebot](https://www.cookiebot.com/da/). This inserts a cookiebot based cookie consent dialogue.

It does only a few things:

* It changes the logo on runtime
* It hides the powered by cookiebot
* It shows alerts for each of the categories which the user gives consent to

See the code in action on [https://cookiebot.netlify.app/](https://cookiebot.netlify.app/)
